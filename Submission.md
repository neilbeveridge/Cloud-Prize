## Which Categories Best Fit Your Submission and Why?
###Best Contribution to Performance Improvements
We seek to improve throughput and reduce latency by modifying Zuul, then benchmark and bake off the two implementations.

## Describe your Submission
We plan to port Zuul to make use of the Netty stack. Netty will provide a SEDA and non-blocking outbound IO which should lead to throughput improvements.
